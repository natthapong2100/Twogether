# Twogether

This is the project in Advance Object Oriented Programming course. In addition, this is a group project which I am the leader and the members have Thanakrit Pitiviroj and Yanapat Emdee. This android application is entirely developed by using Java laguage which use Android Studio application as an IDE and use Parse for collecting the data in the app. Parse is a server that we get it from AWS.
